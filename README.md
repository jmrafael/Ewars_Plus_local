NB: Use these files to test the dashboard Locally. Install INLA running the command below in R:

You can test dashboard I using the demo data  and shapefiles included in this repository under the folder Demo_data

After running dashboard I, you can test dashboard II using the 'Demo.Data.Prospective.csv' file also under the Demo_data folder
